    <p>
      Big thank you, legendary and extremely handsome Net Ninja sir 🙏. When I
      was still young (and confused), you came from the YouTube universe and
      taught me how to read code, speak JavaScript, and run
      <code>node index.js</code> without fear. Because of you, my console is no
      longer red, my errors are now understandable, and my heart is full of
      asynchronous peace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your Node.js course is not just a tutorial, sir, it is a life-changing
      experience. Step by step, calmly calmly, you explained everything like a
      true Indian tech guru: “Don’t worry my friend, it is very simple.” Today I
      can say proudly: I know Node.js, I know Express, and I know how to debug
      like a responsible human being. Thank you, Net Ninja! may your WiFi be
      strong and your code always compile 🔥.
    </p>
